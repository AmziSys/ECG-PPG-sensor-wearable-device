---------------------------- ECG-PPG-sensor-wearable-device -----------------------------

* Intro:
The idea is to design a wearable healthcare device that can use the information (from the ECG-PPg sensor) to determine a patient's heart rate, blood-oxygen saturation (SpO2), and respiration rate

   - ECG (electrocardiography) sensors measure the bio-potential generated by electrical signals that control the expansion and contraction of heart chambers.
   - PPG (photoplethysmography) sensors use light-based technology to sense the rate of blood flow as controlled by the heart's pumping action.
In other words, ECG is a measurement of the electrical activity of the heart, using multiple electrodes. Whereas, PPG is an optical measurement of arterial volume, using photodiodes.


* The project is divided into two parts:
  + The sensor board, which includes:
    - MAX86178 ship (ECG and PPG sensor)
    - Microcontroller ()
    - PPG LEDs and photodiodes
    - Electrodes
    - LDO, oscillator, Connectors 
    - other components...
 + The MCU board, which includes:
    - The microcontroller
    - LDO, ESD, USB, and Oscillator
    - LEDs, buttons, connectors...

The software used is Altium
